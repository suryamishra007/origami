                There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.

                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.          
            </li>
            <li>
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.

                Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.
